// Create a Stateless Functional Component
/*
Components are the core of React. Everything in React is a component and here you will learn how to create one.

There are two ways to create a React component. The first way is to use a JavaScript function. Defining a component in this way creates a stateless functional component. The concept of state in an application will be covered in later challenges. For now, think of a stateless component as one that can receive data and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data. (We'll cover the second way to create a React component in the next challenge.)

To create a component with a function, you simply write a JavaScript function that returns either JSX or null. One important thing to note is that React requires your function name to begin with a capital letter. Here's an example of a stateless functional component that assigns an HTML class in JSX:

// After being transpiled, the <div> will have a CSS class of 'customClass'
const DemoComponent = function() {
  return (
    <div className='customClass' />
  );
};
Because a JSX component represents HTML, you could put several components together to create a more complex HTML page. This is one of the key advantages of the component architecture React provides. It allows you to compose your UI from many separate, isolated components. This makes it easier to build and maintain complex user interfaces.


The code editor has a function called MyComponent. Complete this function so it returns a single div element which contains some string of text.

Note: The text is considered a child of the div element, so you will not be able to use a self-closing tag.
*/

const MyComponent = function () {
    // change code below this line
    return (
        <div>Text</div>
    );
    // change code above this line
}


// Create a React Component usign ES6 class Syntax
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }
    render() {
        // change code below this line
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Hello React!</h1>
            </div>
        );
        // change code above this line
    }
};




// Create a Component with Composition
/*
Now we will look at how we can compose multiple React components together. Imagine you are building an App and have created three components, a Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer.

To compose these components together, you could create an App parent component which renders each of these three components as children. To render a component as a child in a React component, you include the component name written as a custom HTML tag in the JSX. For example, in the render method you could write:

return (
<App>
  <Navbar />
  <Dashboard />
  <Footer />
</App>
)
When React encounters a custom HTML tag that references another component (a component name wrapped in < /> like in this example), it renders the markup for that component in the location of the tag. This should illustrate the parent/child relationship between the App component and the Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer.


In the code editor, there is a simple functional component called ChildComponent and a React component called ParentComponent. Compose the two together by rendering the ChildComponent within the ParentComponent. Make sure to close the ChildComponent tag with a forward slash.

Note: ChildComponent is defined with an ES6 arrow function because this is a very common practice when using React. However, know that this is just a function. If you aren't familiar with the arrow function syntax, please refer to the JavaScript section.
*/

const ChildComponent = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <p>I am the child</p>
        </div>
    );
};

class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>I am the parent</h1>
                { /* change code below this line */}
                <ChildComponent />
                { /* change code above this line */}
            </div>
        );
    }
