// Introducing Inline Styles
/*
There are other complex concepts that add powerful capabilities to your React code. But you may be wondering about the more simple problem of how to style those JSX elements you create in React. You likely know that it won't be exactly the same as working with HTML because of the way you apply classes to JSX elements.

If you import styles from a stylesheet, it isn't much different at all. You apply a class to your JSX element using the className attribute, and apply styles to the class in your stylesheet. Another option is to apply inline styles, which are very common in ReactJS development.

You apply inline styles to JSX elements similar to how you do it in HTML, but with a few JSX differences. Here's an example of an inline style in HTML:

<div style="color: yellow; font-size: 16px">Mellow Yellow</div>

JSX elements use the style attribute, but because of the way JSX is transpiled, you can't set the value to a string. Instead, you set it equal to a JavaScript object. Here's an example:

<div style={{color: "yellow", fontSize: 16}}>Mellow Yellow</div>

Notice how we camelCase the "fontSize" property? This is because React will not accept kebab-case keys in the style object. React will apply the correct property name for us in the HTML.


Add a style attribute to the div in the code editor to give the text a color of red and font size of 72px.

Note that you can optionally set the font size to be a number, omitting the units "px", or write it as "72px".
*/
class Colorful extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div style={{ color: "red", fontSize: "72px" }}>Big Red</div>
        );
    }
};







// Add Inline Styles in React by using const Object to store the styling code
/*
You may have noticed in the last challenge that there were several other syntax differences from HTML inline styles in addition to the style attribute set to a JavaScript object. First, the names of certain CSS style properties use camel case. For example, the last challenge set the size of the font with fontSize instead of font-size. Hyphenated words like font-size are invalid syntax for JavaScript object properties, so React uses camel case. As a rule, any hyphenated style properties are written using camel case in JSX.

All property value length units (like height, width, and fontSize) are assumed to be in px unless otherwise specified. If you want to use em, for example, you wrap the value and the units in quotes, like {fontSize: "4em"}. Other than the length values that default to px, all other property values should be wrapped in quotes.


If you have a large set of styles, you can assign a style object to a constant to keep your code organized. Uncomment the styles constant and declare an object with three style properties and their values. Give the div a color of "purple", a font-size of 40, and a border of "2px solid purple". Then set the style attribute equal to the styles constant.
*/
const styles = {
    color: "purple",
    fontSize: 40,
    border: "2px solid purple"
};
// change code above this line
class Colorful extends React.Component {
    render() {
        // change code below this line
        return (
            <div style={styles}>Style Me!</div>
        );
        // change code above this line
    }
};








// Use Advanced JavaScript in React Render Method by writing JavaScript in the render method, before the return statement

/*
In previous challenges, you learned how to inject JavaScript code into JSX code using curly braces, { }, for tasks like accessing props, passing props, accessing state, inserting comments into your code, and most recently, styling your components. These are all common use cases to put JavaScript in JSX, but they aren't the only way that you can utilize JavaScript code in your React components.

You can also write JavaScript directly in your render methods, before the return statement, without inserting it inside of curly braces. This is because it is not yet within the JSX code. When you want to use a variable later in the JSX code inside the return statement, you place the variable name inside curly braces.


In the code provided, the render method has an array that contains 20 phrases to represent the answers found in the classic 1980's Magic Eight Ball toy. The button click event is bound to the ask method, so each time the button is clicked a random number will be generated and stored as the randomIndex in state. On line 52, delete the string "change me!" and reassign the answer const so your code randomly accesses a different index of the possibleAnswers array each time the component updates. Finally, insert the answer const inside the p tags.
*/
const inputStyle = {
    width: 235,
    margin: 5
}

class MagicEightBall extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            userInput: '',
            randomIndex: ''
        }
        this.ask = this.ask.bind(this);
        this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    }
    ask() {
        if (this.state.userInput) {
            this.setState({
                randomIndex: Math.floor(Math.random() * 20),
                userInput: ''
            });
        }
    }
    handleChange(event) {
        this.setState({
            userInput: event.target.value
        });
    }
    render() {
        const possibleAnswers = [
            'It is certain',
            'It is decidedly so',
            'Without a doubt',
            'Yes, definitely',
            'You may rely on it',

            'Ask again later',
            'Better not tell you now',
            'Cannot predict now',
            'Concentrate and ask again',
            'Don\'t count on it',
            'My reply is no',
            'My sources say no',
            'Most likely',
            'Outlook not so good',
            'Very doubtful'
        ];
        const answer = possibleAnswers[this.state.randomIndex]; // << change code here
        return (
            <div>
                <input
